# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Description

This repository contains my humble attempts to solve various LeetCode challenges. As a self-proclaimed noob who is not particularly strong in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I am using this repo to document my learning journey and progress. Here, you'll find my solutions, explanations, and reflections on the challenges I encounter.

## Features

- **Solutions:** My personal solutions to LeetCode problems, primarily written in C++.
- **Comments:** Detailed comments and explanations within the code to clarify my thought process.
- **Learning Notes:** Additional notes on the concepts and techniques used in the solutions.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keeping track of the problems I've solved and the areas where I need improvement.

## Goals

1. **Improve DSA Skills:** Enhance my understanding of data structures and algorithms through consistent practice.
2. **Documentation:** Maintain a well-documented codebase that can be useful for future reference.
3. **Community Engagement:** Share my learning journey with the community and potentially receive feedback and suggestions.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Solutions:** Browse through the folders to find solutions categorized by problem type (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, etc.).
2. **Read Explanations:** Each solution comes with comments and explanations to help you understand the approach.
3. **Learn Together:** Feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, or share your own solutions.
